# Hi, I'm Rodrigo 👋

I’m a recent Computer Engineering graduate (minor in Neuroscience) passionate about leveraging AI, ML, and neurotechnology to build real‑world systems that connect data, behavior, and biology. Outside of code, I’m an avid literature reader, a movie enthusiast, and an (occasionally) amateur DJ.

## 🧠 Interests

* Data Science & Machine Learning
* NLP & Generative AI (chatbots, style transfer, sarcasm detection)
* EEG signal processing & cognitive applications (Neuroscience)

## 🛠️ Skills

**Languages:** Python, C++, SQL, MATLAB
**ML & Frameworks:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face, Scikit‑learn, PySpark
**Cloud & Tools:** Azure Databricks, FAISS, Power BI, Streamlit, Git, Docker
**Hardware & IoT:** Arduino, Optogenetics LED control

## 🚀 Featured Projects

* 💬 [Succession Chatbot](https://github.com/rod31/succession-chatbot) – Custom Streamlit app that lets you "chat" live with Roman, Shiv, Kendall, or Logan Roy. Extracted and indexed dialogue, built FAISS similarity search, and fine‑tuned GPT to emulate character style.
* 🎛️ [Optogenetics Control System](https://github.com/rod31/optogenetics-gui) – Arduino‑based LED protocol GUI for neuroscience experiments, supporting real‑time, multi‑well light patterns and metadata logging.
* 🧠 [EEG Reaction Time Prediction](https://github.com/rod31/eeg-reaction-time) – SVM model trained on alpha/theta EEG features to classify fast vs. slow reaction times; full ML pipeline in MATLAB.
* 🎥 [IMDB Sentiment Classifier](https://github.com/rod31/imdb-sentiment-analysis) – Benchmark of traditional ML vs. transformer models on review sentiment, with cross‑validation and performance dashboards.
* 📊 [GS1 & Fulton Bank Co‑op](#) – Designed and documented Azure Databricks PySpark pipelines, Azure Data Factory ELT workflows, and Power BI dashboards for enterprise data analytics.
